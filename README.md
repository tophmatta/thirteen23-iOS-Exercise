#Radial Menu
This exercise involved creating a pinterist-like radial menu that allows 
for the user to cycle to the selected view when the tap is released. 
There was a basic hierarchy with the Home view on the top and views 1, 
2, and 3 on bottom lateral to eachother in ascending order from left to right. 
The basic objective was to animate in the selected adjacent view based on its 
relative location to the current view and show it coming from its respective 
location in the hierarchy. (E.g. In going from view 2 to 3 - view 3 would slide 
in from the right)
